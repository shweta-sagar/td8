f your code is running on multiple servers with different environments (locations from where your scripts run) the following idea may be useful to you: 

a. Do not give absolute path to include files on your server. 
b. Dynamically calculate the full path (absolute path) 

Hints: 
Use a combination of dirname(__FILE__) and subsequent calls to itself until you reach to the home of your '/index.php'. Then, attach this variable (that contains the path) to your included files. 

One of my typical example is: 

<?php 
define('__ROOT__', dirname(dirname(__FILE__))); 
require_once(__ROOT__.'/config.php'); 
?> 

instead of: 
<?php require_once('/var/www/public_html/config.php'); ?> 

After this, if you copy paste your codes to another servers, it will still run, without requiring any further re-configurations.
